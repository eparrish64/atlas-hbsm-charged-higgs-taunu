Runs: 325713 - 340453

This folder contains the full 2017 pp dataset GRLs for Periods B-K. 
The GRLs correspond to ***the fast 2017 data-reprocessing*** (i.e. *not* the original tier0 processing).

The luminosity for these GRLs has been calculated using the preliminary 2017 luminosity tag (OflLumi-13TeV-010).
For more information on luminosity tags, please see:
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Atlas/LuminosityForPhysics

~700/pb of data was recovered in the 2017 fast reprocessing, so it is very important that you update to use this new GRL if your analysis is using the reprocessed data.

This folder also contains new "actualMu" pileup rootfiles, since for MC16d and later we use the per-BCID pileup mu distribution rather than the BCID-averaged one.
